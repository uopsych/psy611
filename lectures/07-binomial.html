# Probability: Binomial Distribution

---


### Annoucements

- Mid-term feedback in journals

- Homework #1 due Friday at 9 am
    - attach both .RMD and .html files to submission on Canvas

---

## Last week...

- Introduction to probability

- Jargon (elementary events, sample space, conditional, independence)

- Frequentist
  - probability == long run rate
- Bayesian
  - start with prior belief, incorporate data
  
- Back to frequentist
---



The **binomial distribution** is the theoretical probability distribution appropriate when modeling the expected outcome, X, of N trials (or event sequences) that have the following characteristics:

--
- The outcome on every trial is binary 

    - also called a **Bernoulli trial**

--

- The probability of the target outcome (usually called a “success”) is the same for all N trials 

    - “with replacement” might be necessary

--

- The trials are independent

--

- The number of trials is fixed

---



If these assumptions hold then X is a binomial random variable representing the expected number of successes over N trials, with expected success on each trial of `\(\theta\)` .

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


A common and compact way of stating the same thing is: 

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


`$$\Huge X \sim B(N, \theta)$$`
---

The probability distribution for X is defined by the following **probability mass function**: 

`$$\Large P(X|\theta,N) = \frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}\theta^X(1-\theta)^{N-X}$$`

The probability mass function tells us what to expect for any particular X in the sample space.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

All theoretical distributions have a mass function (if discrete) or a density function (if continuous). These are the defining equations that tells us the generating process for the behavior of X.

???

A common way to write the binomial mass function is to think of `\(\theta\)` as the probability of success `\((p)\)` and `\(1-\theta\)` as the probability of failure `\((q)\)`. It becomes easier to write the function:

$$ P(X|\theta,N) = \frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}p^X(q)^{N-X}$$
---

`$$\Large P(X|\theta,N) = \frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}\theta^X(1-\theta)^{N-X}$$`

***

`\(\mathbf{P(X|\theta,N)}\)` is a conditional probability: the probability of X given `\(\theta\)` and `\(N\)`.

- X is the number of successful trials over N independent trials, with the probability of success on any trial equal to `\(\theta\)`.

- `\(\theta\)` and N are parameters of the binomial distribution.

---

`$$\Large P(X|\theta,N) = \frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}\theta^X(1-\theta)^{N-X}$$`

***

`\(\mathbf{\theta^X(1-\theta)^{N-X}}\)` is the probability of any particular instance of X.  
- This is just a general form of the basic probability rule:

`$$A \text{ and } B = P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$`

Note that this form of the rule assumes *independent events*.

---
For example, let's examine a sequence of 5 independent rolls of a die:

`3  6  6  1  6`

--


This can be represented in binomial form. First we have to choose the value that represents "success." Here, we'll use 6. 

`Not6  6  6  Not6  6`

--

The probability of that particular sequence is then:

`$$P(Not6)P(6)P(6)P(Not6)P(6)$$`

--

`$$P(6)^3P(Not6)^2 = (\frac{1}{6})^3(\frac{5}{6})^2 = 0.0032$$`



---


`$$\Large P(X|\theta,N) = \frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}\theta^X(1-\theta)^{N-X}$$`

***

But a specific sequence of independent outcomes is just one way we could have X successful trials out of N. 

- We need to know **how many possible ways** we could get X successes in N trials.

The remaining part of the equation (the combination rule from probability theory, `\(_XC_N\)`), tells us how many different ways that can happen.

`$$\Large \frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}$$`

---

Returning to our dice example, how many ways are there to roll a six 3 times out of 5?

--

.pull-left[

`6  6  6  Not6 Not6`



`6  6  Not6  6 Not6`



`6  6  Not6  Not6 6`

`6  Not6  6  6  Not6`

`6  Not6  6  Not6  6`
]

.pull-right[

`6  Not6  Not6  6  6`

`Not6  6  6  6  Not6`

`Not6  6  6  Not6  6`

`Not6  6  Not6  6  6`

`Not6  Not6  6  6  6`
]


--

`$$\large \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5\times4\times3\times2\times1}{3\times2\times1(2\times1)}=10$$`
---
Putting the pieces together:

`$$\large P(X = \text{a }6, \text{three times}|\theta_6, N= 5)\\
= \frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}\theta^X(1-\theta)^{N-X}\\=
\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!}(\frac{1}{6})^3(\frac{5}{6})^2\\
= (10)(.0032) \\
=.032$$`

---

A note about notation:

Many texts refer to the probability of success as `\(p\)` and the probability of not success (or failure) as `\(q\)`. 

In some ways, this makes the formula easier to understand:

`$$P(X|p, N)= \frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}p^Xq^{(N-X)}$$`

---

What does the Law of Total Probability require to be true?

![](07-binomial_files/figure-html/binom-plot-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;


```r
data.frame(num = 0:5, p = dbinom(x = 0:5, size = 5, prob = 1/6), three = as.factor(c(0,0,0,1,0,0))) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=num, y=p, fill = three)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + scale_x_continuous("Number of sixes (X) in five rolls (N)", breaks=c(0:5)) +scale_y_continuous("Probability")+ guides(fill = "none") + ggtitle("Binomial Probability Distribution")
```

???

Independent rolls!

---

Every probability distribution has an **expected value** distribution. 

For the binomial distribution:

`$$E(X) = N\theta$$`

--
Each probability distribution also has a variance. For the binomial:

`$$Var(X) = N\theta(1-\theta)$$`
--

Importantly, this means our mean and variance are related in the binomial distribution, because they both depend on `\(\theta\)`. How are they related?

--

If you have a discrete distribution with a small N, these estimates may not have a sensible meaning. 

Later we will use the variance to help us make statements about how confident we are with regard to the location of the mean. 

???

Expected value = most likely result of the probability function,
* the thing we would expect to happen if we have no other information than the parameters of the distribution. 
*the long run average over an infinite amount of trials or samplings

Sensible mean = number of arms example

---

.left-column[
The mean, .835, does not exist in the sample space, and rounding up to 1 and claiming that to be the most typical outcome is not quite right either. 
]

![](07-binomial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;



---

The **probability mass (density) function** allows us to answer other questions about the sample space that might be more important, or at least realistic.
- mass = discrete
- density = continuous

--

I might want to know the value in the sample space at or below which a certain proportion of outcomes fall. This is a **percentile or quantile** question. 
  -  "Most (75%) of five dice rolls yield X or fewer 6's."

--

I might want to know the proportion of outcomes in the sample space that fall at or below a particular outcome. This is a **cumulative proportion** question.
  - "What percentage of the time will my outcome be less than 3?"

---
At or below what outcome in the sample space do .75 of the outcomes fall?

![](07-binomial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
What proportion of outcomes in the sample space that fall at or below a given outcome?

.pull-right[

]

---

In R, we can calculate the cumulative probability (X or lower), using the `pbinom` function.


```r
# what is probability of rolling two or fewer 6's out of five rolls?
pbinom(q = 2, size = 5, prob = 1/6)
```

```
## [1] 0.9645062
```


---

The binomial is of interest beyond describing the behavior of dice and coins.

Many practical outcomes might be best described by a binomial distribution.

For example, suppose I give a 40-item multiple choice test, with each question having 4 options.

* I am worried that students might do well by chance alone.  I would not want to pass students in the class if they were just showing up for the exams and guessing for each question.

* What are the parameters in the binomial distribution that will help me address this question?

???

`\(N = 40\)`
s
`\(\theta = .25\)`

---

![](07-binomial_files/figure-html/binom-plot2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

???
I could use this distribution to help me decide if a given student is consistent with a guessing model.

Nearly all of the outcomes expected for guessers fall below the minimum passing score (60%, D-, 24).

---

How likely is it that a guesser would score above the threshold (60%) necessary to pass the class by the most minimal standards?

$$P(24|.25, 40) + P(25|.25,40) + P(26|.25,40) + ... + P(40|.25, 40) $$
--

&lt;!-- `$$1-P(X = 23|\theta = .25, N= 40)= \\ 1-\frac{23!}{23!(40-23)!}(.25)^{23}(1-.25)^{17}$$` --&gt;

```r
#Note the use of the Law of Total Probability here

1-pbinom(q = 23, size = 40, prob = .25)
```

```
## [1] 2.825967e-06
```

---

Cumulatively, what proportion of guessers will fall below each score?

![](07-binomial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

???

Seems safe to assume that, practically speaking, all guessers will fall below the minimally passing score.

---
###There’s always a but

But, what assumptions are we making and what consequences will they have?

--

* The outcome on every trial is binary (also called a Bernoulli trial)

--

* The probability of the target outcome (usually called a "success") is the same for all N trials ("with replacement" might be necessary)

--

* The trials are independent `\(P(A\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)=P(A)P(B)\)`

--

* The number of trials is fixed

--

In probability and statistics, if the assumptions are wrong then inferences based on those assumptions could be wrong too, perhaps seriously so.

---

&gt; All models are wrong, but some models are useful.  (G.E.P. Box)

We might have viable alternative models:

* **Geometric distribution:**  Used if we are interested in the number of trials required for one "success" to occur 
  * "how many times do I start my computer before it fails to start at all?"
  
---

&gt; All models are wrong, but some models are useful.  (G.E.P. Box)

We might have viable alternative models:

* **Negative binomial distribution:** Used if we are interested in the number of successes in a series of repeated trials until a specified number of failures are seen 
  * "What is the probability that a baseball player will get his 2nd hit on his 4th at-bat?"
  * "A child won't return from trick or treating until they get 5 full-size candy bars. What is the probability that they will have to visit 34 homes to get this?"
  
---

&gt; All models are wrong, but some models are useful.  (G.E.P. Box)

We might have viable alternative models:
* **Poisson distribution:** Used when there's not a fixed number of trials but rather a fixed interval of time. 
  * "What is the expected number of times a solider will be kicked in the head by a horse and die during this one year campaign?"

.small[As N increases, the binomial becomes more normal in appearance.

Because of the difficulties in calculating large factorials, there is a large-sample normal approximation to the binomial. The normal distribution is useful for a lot of other reasons too.
