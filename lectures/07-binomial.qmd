## Last week...

-   Introduction to probability

-   Jargon (elementary events, sample space, conditional, independence)

-   Frequentist

    -   probability == long run rate

-   Bayesian

    -   start with prior belief, incorporate data

-   Back to frequentist

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **binomial distribution** is the theoretical probability distribution appropriate when modeling the expected outcome, X, of N trials (or event sequences) that have the following characteristics:

-   The outcome on every trial is binary

    -   also called a **Bernoulli trial**

-   The probability of the target outcome (usually called a "success") is the same for all N trials

    -   "with replacement" might be necessary

-   The trials are independent

-   The number of trials is fixed

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If these assumptions hold then X is a binomial random variable representing the expected number of successes over N trials, with expected success on each trial of $\theta$ .

A common and compact way of stating the same thing is:

## $$\large X \sim B(N, \theta)$$

The probability distribution for X is defined by the following **probability mass function**:

$$\large P(X|\theta,N) = \frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}\theta^X(1-\theta)^{N-X}$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The probability mass function tells us what to expect for any particular X in the sample space.

All theoretical distributions have a mass function (if discrete) or a density function (if continuous). These are the defining equations that tells us the generating process for the behavior of X.

::: notes
A common way to write the binomial mass function is to think of $\theta$ as the probability of success $(p)$ and $1-\theta$ as the probability of failure $(q)$. It becomes easier to write the function:

$$ P(X|\theta,N) = \frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}p^X(q)^{N-X}$$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$P(X|\theta,N)\color{grey}{ = \frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}\theta^X(1-\theta)^{N-X}}$$

$\mathbf{P(X|\theta,N)}$ is a conditional probability: the probability of X given $\theta$ and $N$.

-   X is the number of successful trials over N independent trials, with the probability of success on any trial equal to $\theta$.

-   $\theta$ and N are parameters of the binomial distribution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$\large\color{grey}{P(X|\theta,N) = \frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}}\theta^X(1-\theta)^{N-X}$$

$\mathbf{\theta^X(1-\theta)^{N-X}}$ is the probability of any particular instance of X.

This is just a general form of the basic probability rule:

$$A \text{ and } B = P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$

Note that this form of the rule assumes *independent events*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, let's examine a sequence of 5 independent rolls of a die:

`3  6  6  1  6`

This can be represented in binomial form. First we have to choose the value that represents "success." Here, we'll use 6.

`Not6  6  6  Not6  6`

The probability of that particular sequence is then:

$$P(Not6)P(6)P(6)P(Not6)P(6)$$

$$P(6)^3P(Not6)^2 = (\frac{1}{6})^3(\frac{5}{6})^2 = `r round(((1/6)^3)*((5/6)^2), 4)`$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$\color{grey}{P(X|\theta,N) = }\frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}\color{grey}{\theta^X(1-\theta)^{N-X}}$$

But a specific sequence of independent outcomes is just one way we could have X successful trials out of N.

We need to know **how many possible ways** we could get X successes in N trials.

The remaining part of the equation (the combination rule from probability theory, $_XC_N$), tells us how many different ways that can happen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Returning to our dice example, how many ways are there to roll a six 3 times out of 5?

$$\large \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5\times4\times3\times2\times1}{3\times2\times1(2\times1)}=10$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Putting the pieces together:

$$\large P(X = \text{''6''}, 3\text{ times}|\theta_6, N= 5)\\
= \frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}\theta^X(1-\theta)^{N-X}\\=
\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!}(\frac{1}{6})^3(\frac{5}{6})^2\\
= (10)(.0032) \\
=.032$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A note about notation:

Many texts refer to the probability of success as $p$ and the probability of not success (or failure) as $q$:

$$P(X|p, N)= \frac{N!}{X!(N-X)!}p^Xq^{(N-X)}$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What does the Law of Total Probability require to be true?

```{r binom-plot}
#| code-fold: true
#| 
data.frame(num = 0:5, p = dbinom(x = 0:5, size = 5, prob = 1/6), three = as.factor(c(0,0,0,1,0,0))) %>% ggplot(aes(x=num, y=p, fill = three)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + scale_x_continuous("Number of sixes (X) in five rolls (N)", breaks=c(0:5)) +scale_y_continuous("Probability")+ guides(fill = "none") + ggtitle("Binomial Probability Distribution")
```

::: notes
Independent rolls!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every probability distribution has an **expected value** distribution.

For the binomial distribution:

$$E(X) = N\theta$$

Each probability distribution also has a variance. For the binomial:

$$Var(X) = N\theta(1-\theta)$$

::: notes
```{r}
#mean
5*(1/6)
#var
5*(1/6)*(5/6)
```
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Importantly, this means our mean and variance are related in the binomial distribution, because they both depend on $\theta$. How are they related?

If you have a discrete distribution with a small N, these estimates may not have a sensible meaning.

Later we will use the variance to help us make statements about how confident we are with regard to the location of the mean.

::: notes
Expected value = most likely result of the probability function, \* the thing we would expect to happen if we have no other information than the parameters of the distribution. \*the long run average over an infinite amount of trials or samplings

The **probability mass (density) function** allows us to answer other questions about the sample space that might be more important, or at least realistic.

-   mass = discrete
-   density = continuous

I might want to know the value in the sample space at or below which a certain proportion of outcomes fall. This is a **percentile or quantile** question.

-   "Most (75%) of five dice rolls yield X or fewer 6's."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I might want to know the proportion of outcomes in the sample space that fall at or below a particular outcome. This is a **cumulative proportion** question. - "What percentage of the time will my outcome be less than 3?"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At or below what outcome in the sample space do .75 of the outcomes fall?

```{r echo = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
#| 
data.frame(num = 0:5, p = dbinom(x = 0:5, size = 5, prob = 1/6)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=num, y=p)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = qbinom(p = .75, size = 5, prob = 1/6)), color = "red") +scale_x_continuous("Number of sixes (X) in five rolls (N)", breaks=c(0:5)) +scale_y_continuous("Probability")+ggtitle("Binomial Probability Distribution")

What proportion of outcomes in the sample space that fall at or below a given outcome?

```
:::
:::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In R, we can calculate the cumulative probability (X or lower), using the `pbinom` function.

```{r}
# what is probability of rolling two or fewer 6's out of five rolls?
pbinom(q = 2, size = 5, prob = 1/6)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The binomial is of interest beyond describing the behavior of dice and coins.

Many practical outcomes might be best described by a binomial distribution.

For example, suppose I give a 40-item multiple choice test, with each question having 4 options.

-   I am worried that students might do well by chance alone. I would not want to pass students in the class if they were just showing up for the exams and guessing for each question.

-   What are the parameters in the binomial distribution that will help me address this question?

::: notes
$N = 40$ s $\theta = .25$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r binom-plot2, echo = F}
limit = 30
data.frame(num = 0:limit, p = dbinom(x = 0:limit, size = 40, prob = .25)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=num, y=p)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + scale_x_continuous("Test Score (0-40) Under a Guessing Model", breaks=seq(0,limit,2)) +scale_y_continuous("Probability")+ggtitle("Binomial Probability Distribution")
```

::: notes
I could use this distribution to help me decide if a given student is consistent with a guessing model.

Nearly all of the outcomes expected for guessers fall below the minimum passing score (60%, D-, 24).
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How likely is it that a guesser would score above the threshold (60%) necessary to pass the class by the most minimal standards?

$$P(24|.25, 40) + P(25|.25,40) + P(26|.25,40) + ... + P(40|.25, 40) $$

```{r}
#Note the use of the Law of Total Probability here
1-pbinom(q = 23, size = 40, prob = .25)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cumulatively, what proportion of guessers will fall below each score?

```{r, echo = F}
limit = 40
data.frame(num = 0:limit, p = pbinom(q = 0:limit, size = 40, prob = .25)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=num, y=p)) + geom_line() + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 24), color = "red") + scale_x_continuous("Test Score (0-40) Under a Guessing Model", breaks=seq(0,limit,2)) +scale_y_continuous("Cumulative Proportion")+ggtitle("Cumulative Binomial Probability Distribution")
```

::: notes
Seems safe to assume that, practically speaking, all guessers will fall below the minimally passing score.

1- pbinom(q = 8, size = 18, prob = 1/3)

### There's always a but

But, what assumptions are we making and what consequences will they have?

-   The outcome on every trial is binary (also called a Bernoulli trial)

-   The probability of the target outcome (usually called a "success") is the same for all N trials ("with replacement" might be necessary)

-   The trials are independent $P(A\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)=P(A)P(B)$

-   The number of trials is fixed

::: notes
In probability and statistics, if the assumptions are wrong then inferences based on those assumptions could be wrong too, perhaps seriously so.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We might have viable alternative models:

-   **Geometric distribution:** Used if we are interested in the number of trials required for one "success" to occur
    -   "how many times do I start my computer before it fails to start at all?"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We might have viable alternative models:

-   **Negative binomial distribution:** Used if we are interested in the number of trials required for a specific number of "successes" to occur
    -   "A child won't return from trick or treating until they get 5 full-size candy bars. What is the probability that they will have to visit 34 homes to get this?"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We might have viable alternative models:

-   **Poisson distribution:** Used when there's not a fixed number of trials but rather a fixed interval of time.
    -   "What is the expected number of times a solider will be kicked in the head by a horse and die during this one year campaign?"
