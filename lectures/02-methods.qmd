From the library:

The library also offers free short workshops. This term, we are offering workshops on R, Python, GitHub, using Zotero to manage your citations, and more. Our Friday lunch chats (Coffee + Data && Code) offer a great opportunity to meet folks interested in data and code from across the university.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why statistics

-   An essential aid to "signal detection"

-   A universal language for communicating what we find.

-   Required for competent evaluation of others' work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goal of today

Advanced skill in quantitative methods carries with it the responsibility to use those skills carefully and ethically.

Today, we'll discuss methodological issues present in statistics.

-   It can be tempting to use statistics to fix poor research design.

-   These issues cannot be fixed quantitatively (even when it looks like they can).

-   After today, we focus on what happens after you collect data. But it is still your job to study research design, data collection, and theoretical logic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Constructs

Our basic goal in science is to make inferences about the causal relations between constructs.

![](images/intro_construct.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
We can't do that directly, so we rely on proxies for those constructs.

:::

:::: {.column width="40%"}
In order to infer that A --\> B, we have to make three assumptions:

::: nonincremental
-   X is a good proxy for A
-   Y is a good proxy for B
-   X and Y are causally related
:::
::::
::::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the first two assumptions are true, the relation between X and Y will provide a good estimate of the relation between A and B.

What threatens our ability to carry out this seemingly simple task?

How do quantitative methods help us solve these problems?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Validity

Four kinds of validity in research threaten our ability to make valid causal inferences. Solving each problem either directly requires quantitative methods or makes use of principles that are central to quantitative methods.

-   Statistical conclusion validity

-   Internal validity

-   External validity

-   Construct validity

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Statistical conclusion validity

**Definition:** the validity of the inference that X and Y are related

![](images/intro_operation.jpg)

-   most basic: correlation coefficient ( $r_{xy}$ )
    -   even more advanced methods index covariation in some way

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### (Some) threats to statistical conclusion validity

-   low statistical power

-   violations of assumptions of statistical tests

-   fishing and the error rate problem

-   unreliable measures

-   restricted range

-   unreliable treatment implementation

-   extraneous variance in the experimental setting

-   heterogeneity of units

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Internal validity

**Definition:** the validity of the inference that X and Y are causally related.

-   Given that X and Y are correlated, can we validly infer that the relation is causal?

-   Traditional view: direction, correlation, confounds (John Stuart Mill, 1843)

-   Counter-factual view: Effect is what did happen compared to what would have happened to the same people had they not had the treatment at the same time.

    -   Major research design tools: manipulation, control, random assignment, replication, logic, common sense.

::: notes
direction = Cause precedes effect

correlation = Cause covaries with effect

confounds = Other explanations are ruled less plausible

Temporal precedence can be established in an experiment because treatment precedes outcome.

But, when treatment is not possible, then logic and common sense can sometimes dictate temporal precedence.

Testing refers to the possible change that may occur just because participants have been previously measured. These are often called practice or fatigue effects.

Ex: Students do better on the first half of test compared to the second. Ex: Students do better in the second half of the term compared to the first.

Without adding a control group, how might this threat be reduced?

Change may occur because the measurement changes over time, perhaps becoming more or less reliable.

Instrumentation reflects changes in the measurement; testing reflects changes in the object of measurement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The key point with internal validity is that something else besides the treatment is a plausible alternative explanation for any apparent treatment effect.

Solving threats to internal validity is a research design problem, not a statistics problem. Nonetheless, quantitative methods play a key role in making the case for internal validity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Removing the influence of other variables

If the "other variables" can be measured, their influence can be statistically controlled so that the hypothesized relation can be detected more accurately.

However:

**Statistical control should best be thought of as a method of last resort, to be used when design controls are not available or have failed.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## External validity

**Definition:** The validity of the inference that a causal relation between operations generalizes to other units, treatments, observations, or settings.

![](images/intro_operation.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Threats to external validity

-   interaction of the causal relation with units

-   interaction of the causal relation with treatment variations

-   interaction of the causal relation with observations

-   interaction of the causal relation with settings

-   context-dependent mediation

-   Quantitative methods provide a powerful way to demonstrate moderation (interactions) and mediation effects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What does it mean to be "valid"?

-   Now's a great time to pause and reflect on validity in general. Some kinds of validity are essential: statistical conclusion, construct.

-   Other types of validity (internal, external) are not necessary for every study, but should be the goals of a *program* of research.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Representativeness

-   What is this? What is it useful for?

-   When is representativeness counterproductive?

::: notes
Rothman argues that representativeness is not a reasonable requirement for scientific research.

overcontrolling for characteristics can clarity an effect

representativeness does not enhance generalizability, but rather knowledge of conditions and mechanisms

sometimes better to oversample smaller populations
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Group discussion

For each of the following, would you say that representativeness (1) improves the study, (2) weakens the study, or (3) has no effect on the study?

::: nonincremental
-   polling to determine the front runner in the Oregon senatorial race
-   polling to determine the front runner in the presidential election
-   testing whether a new SSRI has side effects
-   developing a self-report measure of athleticism
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Rothman, Gallacher, & Hatch (2013)](readings/Rothman_2013.pdf)

**Takeaways**

-   Representativeness may or may not be useful. *It depends!*

-   Often, it's better to either recruit a homogenous sample (to minimize differences between groups or reduce noise)...

-   ... or overrecruit from smaller groups to test for differences.

-   But the biggest takeaway should be that these principles do not apply equally to all studies! You should consider what the goals of YOUR study are and how best to meet those goals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Construct validity

**Definition:** The validity of the inference that a given operationalization of units, treatments, observations, or settings represents well the construct of which it is assumed to be an instance.

![](images/intro_operation.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Threats to construct validity

-   inadequate explication of constructs

-   construct confounding

-   confounding constructs with levels of constructs

-   reactive self-report changes

-   reactivity to the experimental situation

-   experimenter expectancy

-   novelty and disruption effects
