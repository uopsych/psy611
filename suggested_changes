general lab feedback
* restructure first 3 labs to be "incomplete markdown format"***
* make the first minihack easy and walk them through it
* find out what was in the bootcamp and you can skim or gloss that content
* exercises throughout are good
* try to budget at least 20 minutes for mini-hacks
* add in-text R code (reporting sample sizes, means, proper formatting, etc)
* add recaps at the beginning of lectures
* talk about folder organization
* import data files from GitHub for "lecture" part of lab; have students load in different data file for minihacks using working directory

TA expectations
* prep labs (minor tweaks), attend lecture, take quizzes and homework assignments (to give feedback on difficulty and time)


homework general
* B's get degrees 
* don't say "it's in your best interest to attempt all of them"

homework-1.rmd
* include description of homework
* fix "link to data here"
* 10.1 -- clarify that you make the composite by following the steps in order
* 10.1 -- after "justify quantitatively" add, "You may suggest additional data collection as part of the jusitification process."
* 10.2 -- Write "using matrix algebra" at each step?
* 10.2 -- for Variance/Cov, what do you mean by "these data" (specify variables)



lab-1.html
* not enough time
* students using chat -- overwhelming, distracting
* cut out arithmatic stuff (not needed)

5-matrix.html
* Explain the underlining element thing in matrix addition
* "Different from algebra" not "different from linear algebra"
* 1 = 1's not identity
* "Subtraction is not distributive is nonsensical"
* more about relation to statistics
* intimidating?
* pre and post multiplication


quiz-2.docx
* replace word "masquerade"

lab-3.html
* more practice with transformation matrices
  * build up from simple to complex
  * if we move matrix algebra to the end of the term and spread content out across two lectures, should be easier to focus on R code
  * don't name T matrix object "T" but call it "T_mat" or something

6-probability.html
* 

7-binomial.html
* fix slide 17 (confusing wording)

8-normal.html
* take out t, chi-sq, and F? -- maybe go over quickly? 

9-sampling.html
* add non-normal distribution example to excel spreadsheet

10-nhst.html
* "retain" not "fail to reject" the null
* that funny symbol is captial Pi (this just a tip)
* good to start with binomial (keep it up!)
* take out stuff about t-tests?

11-nhst.html
* online demo good (Kristoffer)
* change example with N = SD (confusing!)
* why is this good (sell it before you tear it down)

12-critiques.html
* writing cut off on slide 4 (maybe make figure smaller)
* "ee-one-ee-dees" (ioniddis)

lab-5.html
* dplyr
* pacing is good on this one! (30-40 min left over)
* primarily worked off the .Rmd file, not website
* included download link on the website -- students follow along in the Markdown

13-open_science.html
* good focus on stats not broad
* get a real explaination for publication bias
* another slide is cut off here
* arxiv, bioarxiv
* more practical advice (like at the end)
* good to be realistic (obstacles, slow science)

lab-6.html
* mini mini-hacks during lab worked well
* it's a little long, as always

2-homework.html


lab-7.html
* is this worth having?
* next time, chi-square
  * doing the test
  * frequency tables
  * output tables to word document
  * extracting information
  * in-line R code to summarize results
* or more on data wrangling
  * move summarize here
  * more about first one
    * tidy data
* pros: first year sem already covers some of this?

14-one-sample.html
* reiterate signal/noise

15-two-means_I.html (now 16)
* reiterate signal/noise
* add power

lab-8.html
* include welch's t-test
* good to have them walk through the steps
* had time to go through the mini-hacks
* add power

17-independent-sample.html
* make figures consistent with each other
* spell frequentist correctly

18-effect-sizes.html
* turn off scientific notation
* fix alterantive hypothesis for Levene's test
* pay attention to notation for standard deviation and standard error

  
CHANGES ALREADY ADDRESSED

schedule
* order should be one-sample t-test, paired sample t-tests, independent-samples t, effect sizes (cohen's d and overlap), assumptions and non-parametric tests


1-homework.Rmd
* rewrite correlation freedom/generosity instructions: "calculate the correlation between freedom and generosity" (take out thing about "for a country")
* 5.3 change validity of correlation to "statistical conclusion valdity"
* more time for homeworks? post 2 weeks in advance, instead of 1


12-critiques.html
* fewer quotes at the beginning (be prepared to run out of time) -- have extra day so leaving this in for now?

1-intro.html
* turn off notifications!

2-measurement.html
* Take out C&M? Replace with something else? Remove entirely? It's very dense, and maybe just too much. 

14-one_sample.html
* explain ()
* critical value dashed, test statistic solid lines

15-one_sample.html
* can be quick check 
* use one chi-square example throughout (don't switch back to lecture 14 example)
* change quiz 6 item to be about population mean, not sample mean
* add section here about shift in confidence intervals (95% CI around null mean, 95% around sample mean)

lab-7.html
* great work with Markdown
* maybe move up to week 3 (if moving matrix algebra moved to end of term)?
* on the other hand, nice to have a break from the challenging stuff mid-term
