GENERAL IDEA:
* move matrix algrebra to after t-tests
* make it two days
  * day 1: addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc
  * day 2: using matrix algebra to calculate means, group means, variance/covariance, t-tests (independent and paired)
  * more hands on in lecture

general lab feedback
* make the first minihack easy and walk them through it
* find out what was in the bootcamp and you can skim or gloss that content
* exercises throughout are good
* try to budget at least 20 minutes for mini-hacks
* is it possbile to use the learnr package and have students download shiny apps to run on their computer?
* idea for the future: use learnr package to create labs, bundle these inside a package
* add in-text R code (reporting sample sizes, means, proper formatting, etc)
* add recaps at the beginning of lectures

TA expectations
* prep labs (minor tweaks), attend lecture, take quizzes and homework assignments (to give feedback on difficulty and time)
* less on statistical conclusion validity

homework general
* B's get degrees 
* don't say "it's in your best interest to attempt all of them"

homework-1.rmd
* include description of homework
* fix "link to data here"
* 10.1 -- clarify that you make the composite by following the steps in order
* 10.1 -- after "justify quantitatively" add, "You may suggest additional data collection as part of the jusitification process."
* 10.2 -- Write "using matrix algebra" at each step?
* 10.2 -- for Variance/Cov, what do you mean by "these data" (specify variables)

2-validity.html
* more time with humor example/discussing article (requires curring some lecture material)

lab-1.html
* not enough time
* students using chat -- overwhelming, distracting
* cut out arithmatic stuff (not needed)


3-describing_data_1.html
* use rio to load in data, and explain ../ in file path
* add formula for standard deviation to in addition to R code for standard deviation

4-describing_data_2.html
* clarify "people attribute failures to back luck"
* examples from article -- maybe new examples or don't assign article?

lab-2.html
* 

5-matrix.html
* Explain the underlining element thing in matrix addition
* "Different from algebra" not "different from linear algebra"
* 1 = 1's not identity
* "Subtraction is not distributive is nonsensical"
* more about relation to statistics
* intimidating?
* pre and post multiplication


quiz-2.docx
* replace word "masquerade"

lab-3.html
* more practice with transformation matrices
  * build up from simple to complex
  * if we move matrix algebra to the end of the term and spread content out across two lectures, should be easier to focus on R code
  * don't name T matrix object "T" but call it "T_mat" or something

6-probability.html
* 

7-binomial.html
* fix slide 17 (confusing wording)

8-normal.html
* 

lab-4.html
* 

10-nhst.html
* more on pvalues
* include figure with p-values bunching up at .05
* move ratio of signal to noise here

lab-5.html
* skim tidy data and helper functions, but keep in so people can see them

2-homework.html


lab-7.html
* is this worth having?
* next time, chi-square
  * doing the test
  * frequency tables
  * output tables to word document
  * extracting information
  * in-line R code to summarize results
* or more on data wrangling
  * move summarize here
  * more about first one
    * tidy data
* pros: first year sem already covers some of this?

14-one-sample.html
* reiterate signal/noise

15-two-means_I.html (now 16)
* reiterate signal/noise

lab-8.html
* include welch's t-test
* good to have them walk through the steps
* had time to go through the mini-hacks

17-dependent means.html (now 15)
* the cohen's d discussion is awkward but healthy. keep it in
* pay attention to notation for standard deviation and standard error
* no matter which d you use, say which one or indicate how you calculated

  
CHANGES ALREADY ADDRESSED

schedule
* order should be one-sample t-test, paired sample t-tests, independent-samples t, effect sizes (cohen's d and overlap), assumptions and non-parametric tests


1-homework.Rmd
* rewrite correlation freedom/generosity instructions: "calculate the correlation between freedom and generosity" (take out thing about "for a country")
* 5.3 change validity of correlation to "statistical conclusion valdity"
* more time for homeworks? post 2 weeks in advance, instead of 1


12-critiques.html
* fewer quotes at the beginning (be prepared to run out of time) -- have extra day so leaving this in for now?

1-intro.html
* turn off notifications!

2-measurement.html
* Take out C&M? Replace with something else? Remove entirely? It's very dense, and maybe just too much.
